        <h3>World Cup Data Project</h3>
        <p>For my Data Management, Estimating and Visualization class we were assigned a data visualization project where we combined two sets of data to tell an interesting data story. I chose to combine the highest paid athletes in each country with how many world cups each country has. For this project I had to collect and clean data, merge it in tableau, and design the visualization in tableau.</p>

        <h3>Travel Market Research</h3>
