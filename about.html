  <p>As a Graphic Communication major with a concentration in Design Reproduction Technology at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, I am excited to bring my skills in brand strategy, graphic design, and content creation to a dynamic company. I have experience with Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Canva, and Hootsuite, as well as a strong background in market research and social media management. Designing visual identities and creating engaging marketing campaigns have deepened my passion for storytelling and design. I am eager to explore new opportunities where I can grow creatively and contribute meaningfully.</p>
